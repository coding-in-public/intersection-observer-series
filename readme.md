# Intersection Observer API Video Series
For the next three videos, we’ll be examining the Intersection Observer API in Javascript. With some simple vanilla Javascript, we’ll trigger a class on our nav to add a background color on scroll. The intersection observer is more performant because it doesn’t have to watch every moment you’re scroll. You tell it what to watch and it’ll observe (almost like a click event listener) and run only when necessary.

In this video, I'll show you how to: 
• set up an intersection observer
• add or remove classes when the observed element is in the window (or out of the window)
• and more!
